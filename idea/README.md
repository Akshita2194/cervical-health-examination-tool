<h2><b>Cervisense - Cervical Health Examination and Cancer Screening tool</b></h2>

<b>Project Brief:</b><br>
Cervisense is being developed with the vision to empower each and every individual with enhanced, affordable and accessible Cervical Cancer Care using engineering, design and technology. With Cervisense, our current focus is to save the lives of these women by democratizing Cervical Cancer Screening and empowering Rural and Urban Healthcare systems to undertake mass screening (under WHO’s Cervical cancer elimination strategy launched in Nov 2020) through Point-of-care diagnosis that offers enhanced visualization, real-time results and aids timely screening and treatment for cervical cancer.  

<b>Problem:</b><br>
One woman dies every 2 minutes and 300,000+ women die every year because of Cervical Cancer - a preventable tragedy if screened and treated in the Precancerous stage. In India, 160 million women aged 30-59 years are at risk of developing Cervical Cancer; still less than 30% of women (aged 30-49) have ever been screened. WHO recommends VIA for low-resource countries like India. However, lack of trained health-workers, reliable technology and access to screening-facilities, hamper implementation. Moreover, subjective interpretation by healthcare-workers, lack of cervical-image record keeping and lower specificity results in higher case-referrals and 50% follow-up loss.

<b>Solution:</b><br>
Cervisense – portable, non-invasive, point-of-care imaging device for quick, enhanced and automated Cervical Health Examination and Cancer Screening.  It consists of an optical imaging camera with a light source and uses advanced imaging techniques to produce high-resolution magnified medical-grade images of the cervix to aid the Healthcare provider in better visualization and diagnosis. It standardizes input images by consistently capturing images with similar brightness, hue and saturation values. The device uses zoom and Digital Green Filter for enhanced Visualization of the Cervix and Cervical Image Capture. The images captured, are then, fed to the software running on Tablet for Diagnosis, Patient Record Management, Case Sharing & Treatment follow-up.
